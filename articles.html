				<p>Animal abuse in the Philippines remains a serious concern despite existing laws, such as the Animal Welfare Act (Republic Act 8485), which penalizes cruelty. Issues range from severe cases of direct abuse, like the high-profile killing of a golden retriever in Bicol, to widespread neglect of stray animals. Stray dogs and cats often suffer from hunger, disease, or accidents, exacerbated by inadequate management programs. Inhumane practices like culling further highlight the need for improved strategies and compassion in addressing these issues.
				Recent advocacy efforts include proposals to strengthen laws, such as Senate Bill 2458, which aims to improve animal welfare programs in local communities. These efforts focus on stricter law enforcement, promoting spay/neuter campaigns, and increasing public awareness about responsible pet ownership. Grassroots initiatives, such as community-led cat care programs, demonstrate that humane solutions are possible when combined with education and collaboration</p>

				<p>The Philippines has seen a significant reduction in killing dogs for their meat, with the highest ownership of pet dogs in Asia in 2021. However, people continue to be arrested for trafficking in dogs for pulutan. Many dogs are chained or kept in small cages as living alarm systems and house guards. Some Filipinos have no compunction about torturing and killing dogs. Mall security guard Jojo Malicdem faced criminal charges for tossing a puppy to death off a footbridge in Quezon City, claiming he was trying to drive away beggars. He is facing trial on charges filed by the Philippine Animal Welfare Society for violation of Republic Act 8485, the Animal Welfare Act of 1988, as amended by RA 10631.
				In Bato, Camarines Sur, video footage showed Anthony Solares chasing and beating a Golden Retriever, Killua, who was later found dead in a sack. Solares invoked self-defense, claiming Killua had become aggressive. He is expected to face a criminal complaint for animal cruelty. Sen. Grace Poe is pressing for the approval of the Revised Animal Welfare Act, which seeks to make animal welfare education mandatory in elementary and high school curriculums and create task forces at the barangay level for prompt response to animal welfare issues.

				<p>What is Animal Abuse?
				Animal abuse is defined as the crime of causing physical, emotional, or sexual harm to an animal. Abuse can also include participation in events such as animal fights or excessive neglect. In many cases, the animal will suffer from long term health conditions as a result of animal abuse. Occasionally, the animal will die. The act of animal abuse can be committed either deliberately or unintentionally, but in either case, the animal is put in danger of harm or death.
				What is animal cruelty, and how does it differ from animal abuse? Abuse encompasses a wide range of acts, such as physical harm or neglect. Although the terms can be used interchangeably, animal cruelty most often refers to acts of direct physical hurt or harm done to an animal. Indirect actions such as neglect, while cruel, are not immediately impactful to the animal and therefore are considered part of the wider definition of abuse.

				Animal abuse encompasses a number of actions. Physical, emotional or sexual abuse, as well as neglect, are all considered animal abuse.

				animal abuse definition
				What is considered animal abuse? Animal abuse is identified as any act that puts an animal in danger of their lives. Any act of physical abuse, fighting, torture, intercourse, confinement, hoarding, killing, or inhumane conditions can be considered animal abuse. Signs of abuse include visible wounds, tick or flea infestations, and missing patches of fur. Animal abuse is a serious offense and is illegal in many states, resulting in misdemeanor or felony charges for perpetrators.

				Types of Animal Cruelty
				Animal cruelty encapsulates a variety of offenses, all of which cause harm to an animal. While there are many types of animal cruelty, they all possess the common trait of inflicting damage. Some varieties of animal cruelty include:

				Physical abuse: Assault, torture, animal fighting, inhumane methods of training, inflicting unnecessary pain
				Emotional abuse: Long-term mental conditions caused by actions such as preventing social interaction with other animals
				Sexual abuse: Any sexual conduct with an animal that results in pain or death to the animal
				Hoarding: Confining a large number of animals in a small area or inadequate living conditions
				Killing: The unnecessary death of animals, whether intentional or caused by other types of abuse
				Neglect: The deprivation of adequate sources of food, water, or shelter</p>
