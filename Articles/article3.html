				What is Animal Abuse?
				Animal abuse is defined as the crime of causing physical, emotional, or sexual harm to an animal. Abuse can also include participation in events such as animal fights or excessive neglect. In many cases, the animal will suffer from long term health conditions as a result of animal abuse. Occasionally, the animal will die. The act of animal abuse can be committed either deliberately or unintentionally, but in either case, the animal is put in danger of harm or death.

				<b>What is animal cruelty, and how does it differ from animal abuse?</b>
				<br>
				Abuse encompasses a wide range of acts, such as physical harm or neglect. Although the terms can be used interchangeably, animal cruelty most often refers to acts of direct physical hurt or harm done to an animal. Indirect actions such as neglect, while cruel, are not immediately impactful to the animal and therefore are considered part of the wider definition of abuse.

				Animal Abuse encompasses a number of actions. Physical, emotional or sexual abuse, as well as neglect, are all considered animal abuse.

				<b>Animal Abuse Definition</b>
				<br>
				What is considered animal abuse? Animal abuse is identified as any act that puts an animal in danger of their lives. Any act of physical abuse, fighting, torture, intercourse, confinement, hoarding, killing, or inhumane conditions can be considered animal abuse. Signs of abuse include visible wounds, tick or flea infestations, and missing patches of fur. Animal abuse is a serious offense and is illegal in many states, resulting in misdemeanor or felony charges for perpetrators.

				<b>Types of Animal Cruelty</b>
				<br>
				Animal cruelty encapsulates a variety of offenses, all of which cause harm to an animal. While there are many types of animal cruelty, they all possess the common trait of inflicting damage. Some varieties of animal cruelty include:

				<br>
				<br>

				Physical abuse: Assault, torture, animal fighting, inhumane methods of training, inflicting unnecessary pain
				Emotional abuse: Long-term mental conditions caused by actions such as preventing social interaction with other animals
				Sexual abuse: Any sexual conduct with an animal that results in pain or death to the animal
				Hoarding: Confining a large number of animals in a small area or inadequate living conditions
				Killing: The unnecessary death of animals, whether intentional or caused by other types of abuse
