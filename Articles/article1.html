				<h2>State of Animal Welfare</h2>
				<h4>Author: Mamarion, Ruemar Kris; Date Created: November 26, 2024</h4>
				<br>
				<p>Animal abuse in the Philippines remains in a critical concern despite the presence of existing laws, such as the Animal Welfare Act (Republic Act 8485), which penalizes acts of cruelty, rudeness and lack of consideration for animals. The problem encompassed severe cases of direct abuse, including the widely publicized killing of a golden retriever in Bicol, as well as the widespread neglect of stray animals. Stray dogs and cats frequently endure hunger, disease, and accidents, all of which are worsened by inadequate management programs. Additionally inhuman practices like culling highlight the pressing need for more compassionate and effective strategies to address these issues. 
				Efforts to tackle these problems include recent advocacy initiatives aimed at strengthening legal protections for animals. For instance, Senate Bill 2458 proposes enhancements to animal welfare programs in local communities. These initiatives emphasize stricter enforcement of laws, the promotion of spay/neuter campaigns, events, and increased public education about responsible pet ownership. Grassroots efforts, such as community-led programs for caring for stray cats, further demonstrate that humane and practical solutions are achievable through education and collaboration. The growing involvement of both organizations and individuals underscores the potential to create a more human society for animals when awareness and cooperative action are prioritized.</p>
