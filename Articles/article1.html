				<h2>State of Animal Welfare</h2>
				<p>Animal abuse in the Philippines remains a serious concern despite existing laws, such as the Animal Welfare Act (Republic Act 8485), which penalizes cruelty. Issues range from severe cases of direct abuse, like the high-profile killing of a golden retriever in Bicol, to widespread neglect of stray animals. Stray dogs and cats often suffer from hunger, disease, or accidents, exacerbated by inadequate management programs. Inhumane practices like culling further highlight the need for improved strategies and compassion in addressing these issues.
				Recent advocacy efforts include proposals to strengthen laws, such as Senate Bill 2458, which aims to improve animal welfare programs in local communities. These efforts focus on stricter law enforcement, promoting spay/neuter campaigns, and increasing public awareness about responsible pet ownership. Grassroots initiatives, such as community-led cat care programs, demonstrate that humane solutions are possible when combined with education and collaboration</p>
