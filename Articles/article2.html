      				<p>The Philippines has seen a significant reduction in killing dogs for their meat, with the highest ownership of pet dogs in Asia in 2021. However, people continue to be arrested for trafficking in dogs for pulutan. Many dogs are chained or kept in small cages as living alarm systems and house guards. Some Filipinos have no compunction about torturing and killing dogs. Mall security guard Jojo Malicdem faced criminal charges for tossing a puppy to death off a footbridge in Quezon City, claiming he was trying to drive away beggars. He is facing trial on charges filed by the Philippine Animal Welfare Society for violation of Republic Act 8485, the Animal Welfare Act of 1988, as amended by RA 10631.
      				In Bato, Camarines Sur, video footage showed Anthony Solares chasing and beating a Golden Retriever, Killua, who was later found dead in a sack. Solares invoked self-defense, claiming Killua had become aggressive. He is expected to face a criminal complaint for animal cruelty. Sen. Grace Poe is pressing for the approval of the Revised Animal Welfare Act, which seeks to make animal welfare education mandatory in elementary and high school curriculums and create task forces at the barangay level for prompt response to animal welfare issues.
